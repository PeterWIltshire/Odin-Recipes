    <h3>Description</h3>
    <P> This honey bbq chicken is so great for family barbecues! Plus the homemade honey barbecue sauce is amazing and easy to make! So much better than anything that you can buy at the store. Think fewer preservatives and more great flavor! Our homemade honey bbq sauce is sweet and tangy and just delicious, we smothered it all over our chicken.</P>
